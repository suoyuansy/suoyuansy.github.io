## Quick Start

⚠️ **IMPORTANT: Use as Template, Don't Fork!**

**DO NOT FORK** this repository directly. Forking will copy all development branches, which is unnecessary and not recommended.

### To create your personal website:

1. Click the **"Use this template"** button at the top right of this page
2. Select **"Create a new repository"**
3. Name your repository: `your-github-username.github.io`
4. Clone your new repository locally

### Deploy your website:

1. Go to your repository's **Settings** → **Pages**
2. Under **Source**, select **"Deploy from a branch"**
3. Choose **Branch**: `master` and **Folder**: `/ (root)`
4. Click **Save**
5. Your website will be live at `https://your-github-username.github.io`

### Customize:

Replace the template content on the `master` branch with your own information. The website will automatically rebuild and deploy your changes.

## Demo

Check out the live demo to see how the website looks and functions: [aaronchou313.github.io](https://aaronchou313.github.io)

❗**Note:** This demo website is Aaron Chou's official academic website, but you can use it to preview the template's functionality and design.

### Page Previews

## Local Development

For local development and testing, you can use VS Code with the Live Server extension:

1. Install the "Live Server" extension in VS Code
2. Open [index.html](index.html) in VS Code
3. Right-click anywhere in the editor
4. Select "Open with Live Server"
5. Your browser will automatically open and display the website

This method allows you to preview changes in real-time during development without deploying to GitHub Pages.

## Responsive Design
This website supports responsive design and can be accessed normally on mobile devices. However, for the best viewing experience, we recommend accessing it on a PC.

## Customization Guide

### Configuration Files

All personal information is stored in the `config` directory. Modify these JSON files to customize your website:

- `basic-config.json`: Site title, description, and basic metadata
- `navigation-config.json`: Navigation menu configuration
- `profile-config.json`: Personal information, motto, and social links
- `experience-config.json`: Education, research, and work experience
- `awards-config.json`: Honors and awards
- `publications-config.json`: Publications and research works
- `works-config.json`: Projects and portfolio items

### Content Management

Page content is stored as markdown files in the `content` directory:

- Main pages are directly in the `content` folder
- Project details are in the `content/works` subfolder

### Media Assets

Replace images in the `assets/images` directory:
- `assets/images/award`: Images for awards/honors
- `assets/images/publication`: Images for publications
- `assets/images/work`: Images for projects and works

## Adding or Removing Pages

### To Add a New Page:
1. Add a new entry in `config/navigation-config.json`
2. Create a corresponding markdown file in the `content` directory

### To Remove a Page:
1. Remove the entry from `config/navigation-config.json`
2. Delete the corresponding markdown file from the `content` directory

## Managing Projects/Works

### To Add a New Project:
1. Add a new entry in `config/works-config.json`
2. Create a detailed markdown file in `content/works` directory

### To Remove a Project:
1. Remove the entry from `config/works-config.json`
2. Delete the corresponding markdown file from `content/works` directory

## Technical Architecture

The website is built as a single-page application where different content sections are dynamically loaded:

- Main entry point: `index.html`
- Navigation logic: When users click on menu items, the corresponding markdown content is loaded and rendered in the main content area
- JavaScript modules handle routing, content loading, and dynamic rendering

This architecture allows for a seamless user experience while maintaining the simplicity of static site hosting through GitHub Pages.

## Architecture Overview

This is a single-page application (SPA) built with vanilla JavaScript that dynamically loads content based on URL parameters. The architecture separates concerns through:

1. **Configuration-driven content**: Most content is stored in JSON config files
2. **Markdown-based pages**: Detailed content is written in markdown format
3. **Component-based loading**: Each section has dedicated JavaScript loaders
4. **Centralized routing**: ContentRouter.js manages page navigation and content loading
5. **Modular styling**: CSS is organized by section for maintainability
6. **Static asset organization**: Images and icons are categorized by usage

The website is designed to be easily forked and customized, with all personal information contained in the config files and content directories.
